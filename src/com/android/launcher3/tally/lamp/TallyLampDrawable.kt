/**
 * The animated Tally lamp as a drawable, for views: [TallyLampView] wraps one, and it works as an
 * image or a compound drawable (`setCompoundDrawablesRelativeWithIntrinsicBounds`). It draws the
 * lamp at [lampSizePx], centred in its bounds on whole pixels; its intrinsic size is the lamp plus
 * the live lamp's ring of light ([haloReachPx] on each side), so every state fits the same box.
 * With smaller bounds the ring of light draws past them, which is fine where the host does not
 * clip.
 *
 * It asks its host (the drawable callback: a view's choreographer) for the next frame only after
 * drawing one that still moves, so a lamp that is not drawn schedules nothing, and one that is
 * still schedules nothing at all. Hosts that pass their visibility to [setVisible] (images,
 * backgrounds, [TallyLampView]) also drop a frame already asked for. Changes made while the lamp is
 * hidden, or before its first frame, are at once.
