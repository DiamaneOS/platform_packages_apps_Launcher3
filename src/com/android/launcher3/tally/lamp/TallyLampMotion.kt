/**
 * A lamp's motion, as the prototype's `T.Lamp`, shared by the drawable and the Compose lamp.
 * - The disc's fill (its radius as a fraction of the on disc's) and the live lamp's ring of light
 *   move on the fill spring. A lamp that lights ignites: its fill starts from the ignite fraction,
 *   not from nothing. A change caught mid-flight goes on from where the lamp is, at its speed.
 *   Effects never overshoot, so the target stops a spring that would pass it.
 * - The ring changes form and colour at once; the painter hides it while the lamp is lit.
 * - The requested dashes turn once per turn time for as many whole turns as fit before the lamp is
 *   still (three), then rest where they started.
 * - A lamp that appears with [setState]'s `instantAppear` (sensor lamps, the privacy rule) is lit
 *   at once; only its disappearance moves.
 *
 * Times are uptime milliseconds, the frame clock of `AnimationUtils.currentAnimationTimeMillis`.
 * The springs follow the animator duration scale; at 0 (animations off) every change is at once and
 * the dashes do not turn. The turn keeps real time, as it counts towards "Still trying…". Nothing
 * is allocated after construction.
